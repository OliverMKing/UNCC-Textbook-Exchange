    <h2>What is UNCC Textbook Exhange?</h2>
    <p>
        UNCC Textbook Exchange is a convenient and safe platform for UNC
        Charlotte students to swap, sell, and purchase textbooks.
    </p>
    <h3>Why did we make it?</h3>
    <p>
        There are other sites such as Craigslist which allow users to
        buy and sell items free of charge, but what you sacrifice for cost
        and convenience is safety.  Look around online and there are 
        countless numbers of Craigslist horror stories ranging from awkward
        and weird to downright scary.  With our site we require that all 
        users have a valid UNCC email address, so you know youâ€™re dealing 
        with one of your peers.
    </p>
    <h4>Who made it?</h4>
